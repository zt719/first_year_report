\chapter{Conclusion}

In this section, we explicitly state the research questions, as well as the current progress to address the questions.

\subsubsection*{Questions}

Containers provide a semantics for strictly positive functors. By applying the $W$-type construction, they can be used to represent strictly positive inductive types. However, this framework does not capture all inductive types. For instance, those whose signatures involve higher-order kinds.

To address this limitation, we aim to develop a notion of higher-order containers, thereby providing a categorical and semantic interpretation of such higher-order inductive types.

\subsubsection*{Progress}

Up to this stage, we have obtained several promising results. We have already:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{built a notion of higher functorialities for higher types}
  \item{defined syntax categories for higher containers}
  \item{showed that higher containers are closed under products, coproducts and compositions}
  \item{partly proved that higher containers give rise to a SCwF}.
\end{itemize}

Nevertheless, there remain many open tasks, which we will outline in detail in the following section.
