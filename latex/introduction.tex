\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background and Motivation}

The concept of types is one of the most important features in most modern programming languages. It is introduced to classify variables and functions, enabling more meaningful and readable codes as well as ensuring type correctness. Types such as \textit{boolean}, \textit{natural number}, \textit{list}, \textit{binary tree}, etc. are massively used in everyday programming.
