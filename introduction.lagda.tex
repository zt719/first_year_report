\section{Background and Motivation}

One fundamental feature of programming languages is their type system, which allows classification of values and prevents potential type errors. Concrete examples of types include \textit{unit}, \textit{boolean}, \textit{natural number}, etc. Additionally, there is bigger class of types which enable the construction of higher-kinded types by parameterizing over other types, such as \textit{list}, \textit{binary tree}, \textit{maybe}, etc.

Here is a piece of agda code:

\begin{code}[hide]
module Introduction where

open import Data.Nat public
\end{code}

\AgdaTarget{List}
\AgdaTarget{[]}
\AgdaTarget{∷, \_∷\_}
\AgdaTarget{++, \_++\_}
\AgdaTarget{BTree}
\AgdaTarget{leaf}
\AgdaTarget{node}
\AgdaTarget{flatten}
\begin{code}
data List (X : Set) : Set where
  []  : List X
  _∷_ : X → List X → List X  

_++_ : {X : Set} → List X → List X → List X
[] ++ ys = ys
(x ∷ xs) ++ ys = x ∷ (xs ++ ys)

data BTree (X : Set) : Set where
  leaf : BTree X
  node : BTree X → X → BTree X → BTree X

flatten : {X : Set} → BTree X → List X
flatten leaf = []
flatten (node lt x rt) = flatten lt ++ (x ∷ flatten rt)
\end{code}
